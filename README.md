# MAC scheduler simulator
this project is a school but I want to play with it and have fun.

in this simulator I distinguish 2 kind of mobile **near** or **far**
for distinguish I just look at distance between Antenna and Mobile.

## MAC Scheduler implemented

this simulator implements those scheduler:
* MaxSNR
* RoundRobin
* pf work in progress 

## parameters

I need to fill it.

## mkn generation 

the mkn generation for mobile I ignore:
* shadowing , for mobile of same groups it's the same
* path-lost , for mobile of same groups it's the same

I simulate multi-path fading with rayleigh random law
